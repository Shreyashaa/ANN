import numpy as np 

The code you provided imports the NumPy library, which is a powerful library for numerical computing in Python. It provides support for large, multi-dimensional arrays and matrices, along with a collection of mathematical functions to operate on these arrays efficiently.

By importing numpy as np, you assign the alias np to the NumPy library, which is a common convention used in the Python community to make it easier to refer to NumPy functions and objects.

Once NumPy is imported, you can use its functions and classes throughout your code for various numerical computations and manipulations.

def sigmoid (x):
    return 1/(1 + np.exp(-x))

def sigmoid_derivative(x):
    return x * (1 - x)
ChatGPT
The code snippet you provided defines two functions: sigmoid and sigmoid_derivative. Let's break down each function:

sigmoid(x):

This function takes a parameter x as input.
It calculates the sigmoid function, which is a common activation function used in machine learning and neural networks.
The sigmoid function is defined as 1 / (1 + np.exp(-x)), where np.exp(-x) computes the exponential value of -x.
The function returns the result of the sigmoid calculation.
sigmoid_derivative(x):

This function also takes a parameter x as input.
It calculates the derivative of the sigmoid function.
The derivative of the sigmoid function is computed as x * (1 - x).
The function returns the derivative value.
These functions are commonly used in neural networks, particularly in the context of backpropagation, where the derivative of the activation function is necessary for updating the network's weights during training. The sigmoid function squashes the input values between 0 and 1, making it useful for models that require binary classification or probability estimates.

The code snippet you provided sets up the input datasets and defines some variables for a neural network. Let's break it down:

inputs:

This variable represents the input dataset for the neural network.
It is a NumPy array with shape (4, 2), indicating that there are 4 samples and each sample has 2 features.
Each row in the array corresponds to a different input sample.
expected_output:

This variable represents the expected output for the corresponding input samples.
It is a NumPy array with shape (4, 1), indicating that there are 4 output samples and each sample has 1 dimension (in this case, a single value).
Each row in the array corresponds to the expected output for the corresponding input sample.
epochs:

This variable represents the number of training iterations or epochs.
In this case, the neural network will be trained for 10000 epochs.
lr:

This variable represents the learning rate or the step size for the gradient descent optimization algorithm.
It determines how much the weights of the neural network are adjusted during each iteration of training.
inputLayerNeurons, hiddenLayerNeurons, outputLayerNeurons:

These variables define the number of neurons (units) in each layer of the neural network.
inputLayerNeurons represents the number of neurons in the input layer.
hiddenLayerNeurons represents the number of neurons in the hidden layer.
outputLayerNeurons represents the number of neurons in the output layer.
Overall, this code sets up the input datasets, defines the expected outputs, and specifies the configuration parameters for a neural network.

d_predicted_output = error * sigmoid_derivative(predicted_output): This line calculates the derivative of the predicted output with respect to the error, using the derivative of the sigmoid function (sigmoid_derivative).
error_hidden_layer = d_predicted_output.dot(output_weights.T): This line calculates the error of the hidden layer by performing a dot product between the derivative of the predicted output and the transpose of the output weights.
d_hidden_layer = error_hidden_layer * sigmoid_derivative(hidden_layer_output): This line calculates the derivative of the hidden layer output with respect to the error of the hidden layer, using the derivative of the sigmoid function.
Updating Weights and Biases:

output_weights += hidden_layer_output.T.dot(d_predicted_output) * lr: This line updates the weights of the output layer by performing a dot product between the transpose of the hidden layer output and the derivative of the predicted output, scaled by the learning rate (lr).
output_bias += np.sum(d_predicted_output, axis=0, keepdims=True) * lr: This line updates the biases of the output layer by summing the derivative of the predicted output along the rows (axis=0), scaled by the learning rate.
hidden_weights += inputs.T.dot(d_hidden_layer) * lr: This line updates the weights of the hidden layer by performing a dot product between the transpose of the input data and the derivative of the hidden layer output, scaled by the learning rate.
hidden_bias += np.sum(d_hidden_layer, axis=0, keepdims=True) * lr: This line updates the biases of the hidden layer by summing the derivative of the hidden layer output along the rows (axis=0), scaled by the learning rate.
